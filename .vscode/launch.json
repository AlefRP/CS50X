    /**
    * This is a configuration file for the Visual Studio Code debugger specifically tailored for C projects.
    * It sets up the environment for building and debugging C code using GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) and GDB (GNU Debugger).
    *
    * "version": Specifies the configuration file format version.
    * "configurations": An array of debug configurations.
    *
    * Each configuration object includes:
    * - "name": A descriptive name for the configuration, useful for identification.
    * - "type": The type of debugger to use, here set to cppdbg for C++ debugging.
    * - "request": Indicates the action to be performed, set to "launch" to start debugging.
    * - "program": The path to the executable generated from the C++ code. It dynamically refers to the active file in the editor.
    * - "args": An array to specify command-line arguments for the program.
    * - "stopAtEntry": A boolean to decide if the debugger should stop at the program entry point.
    * - "cwd": Sets the current working directory for the debugger, typically the workspace folder.
    * - "environment": An array to specify environment variables.
    * - "externalConsole": If set to true, uses an external console for the debugging session.
    * - "MIMode": Specifies the debugger interface, here set to gdb.
    * - "setupCommands": Additional commands for the debugger, like enabling pretty-printing.
    * - "preLaunchTask": Specifies a task to run before starting the debug session, typically a build task.
    * - "miDebuggerPath": The path to the debugger executable.
    *
    * This configuration aids in building and debugging C++ files directly from the Visual Studio Code environment, streamlining the development process.
